# Project Overview

This project include a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I had to accept challenge and finished their work.


## Why this Project? 

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## How to run this Project?
* Just clone this repository or download ZIP file.
* Project contains Jasmine 2.1.2 version.
* All needed library are also included.
* Test suites are in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.
